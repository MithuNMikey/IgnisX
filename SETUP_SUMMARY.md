## 🚀 Next Steps (Follow in Order)

### Step 1: Get Your Credentials

You need 3 credentials (all free):

1. **Alchemy API Key**
   - Sign up: https://www.alchemy.com/
   - Get API key: https://dashboard.alchemyapi.io
   - Take ~2 minutes

2. **WalletConnect Project ID**
   - Sign up: https://cloud.walletconnect.com
   - Create project → Get ID
   - Take ~2 minutes

3. **Sepolia ETH**
   - Get free ETH: https://www.alchemy.com/faucets/ethereum-sepolia
   - Send 0.5 ETH to your deployer wallet
   - Take ~5 minutes

**Total time: ~10 minutes**

---

### Step 2: Create Environment Files

**A. In `packages/nextjs/` create `.env.local`:**

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_ALCHEMY_API_KEY=paste_your_alchemy_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLET_CONNECT_PROJECT_ID=paste_your_walletconnect_id
```

**B. In project root create `.env`:**

```env
ALCHEMY_API_KEY=paste_your_alchemy_key
__RUNTIME_DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY=paste_your_deployer_private_key
ETHERSCAN_V2_API_KEY=paste_your_etherscan_key_optional
```

**⚠️ Important:**
- Never commit these files to Git
- Never share your private keys
- Already added to `.gitignore`

---

### Step 3: Install Dependencies

```bash
# From project root
yarn install
```

Wait for installation to complete (~2-3 minutes).

---

### Step 4: Get a Deployer Account

```bash
cd packages/hardhat

# List existing accounts
yarn account:list

# OR create a new account
yarn account:new
# Save the private key shown!

# Copy the address
# Get Sepolia ETH for this address from faucet
```

---

### Step 5: Deploy to Sepolia

```bash
# Make sure you're in packages/hardhat
cd packages/hardhat

# Deploy all contracts
yarn deploy --network sepolia
```

**Expected output:**
```
Deploying IgnisX to Sepolia...
✖ IgnisX deployed to: 0x...
```

**Save all contract addresses!** You'll need them.

---

### Step 6: Start Frontend

```bash
# From project root
yarn start

# Or
cd packages/nextjs
yarn dev
```

Open: http://localhost:3000

---

### Step 7: Test Everything

1. **Open http://localhost:3000**
2. **Connect MetaMask**
   - Make sure you're on Sepolia network
3. **Create a portfolio**
4. **Add assets**
5. **Test autopilot delegation**
